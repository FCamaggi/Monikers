## GAME STRUCTURE

**ROUND 1**
After you finish the entire deck, you'll play a second round with the same cards.

**ROUND 2**
But now you can **ONLY GIVE ONE WORD CLUES.**

**ROUND 3**
Then you play a third round using the same cards again, but can **ONLY DO CHARADES.**

---

## GETTING STARTED

Start off by dealing some cards to everyone playing. You'll all be picking the ones you like to add to the single deck that you're all going to play with.

Depending on the number of people playing, deal that many below to each person. Then they secretly pick the amount listed to include in the deck.

| PLAYERS         | DEAL | PICK |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- |
| **6 PLAYERS**   | 14   | 7    |
| **7 PLAYERS**   | 12   | 6    |
| **8 PLAYERS**   | 10   | 5    |
| **9 PLAYERS**   | 10   | 5    |
| **10+ PLAYERS** | 8    | 4    |

- Divide into two teams of roughly the same size and experience level. If one team has an extra person, that's OK.

- People should pick the cards they think are funny or interesting or weird.

- If people don't know the names on a lot of the cards they were dealt, just deal more cards to them to pick from.

- It's not a huge decision, so you don't have to think too hard about it.

**Deck Assembly:**

1. Collect **ALL** the cards people chose and shuffle them into **ONE** deck.

2. Put the cards people didn't pick back in the box.

3. This deck will be used by both teams for the entire game.

4. Be careful not to mix up the discards and the included cards!

**Notes:**

- If you have 5 or fewer players, or want a less competitive game, play cooperatively without teams! (See Co-op Mode rules below).

- **MONIKERS IS 17+**, but you can remove the cards with the NSFW tag if you prefer an all-ages game.

- **THE MOST FAMOUS PERSON GOES FIRST.**

## HOW TO PLAY

Monikers is played in 3 rounds. Teams alternate taking 60 second turns, where a person from their team stands up in front of the group, draws cards from the deck, and gives clues to get their team to guess as many names as possible before time runs out.

1. Assign someone to be the "timer person" who will start a 60-second timer on their phone and say "3, 2, 1, go!"

2. Once they do, the clue giver flips over the entire deck to the side with names and starts giving clues.

3. There’s no limit to the number of guesses people can make, and the clue giver is encouraged to skip cards they’re having difficulty with.

- When you **skip** a card, just put it on the bottom of the deck.

- When you get one **right**, quickly put it aside somewhere.

### CLOSE ENOUGH IS GOOD ENOUGH

If someone says part of the name, or gets part of the name wrong, that counts.

- **BLOWDART** = BLOWGUN
- **T-REX** = TYRANNOSAURUS
- **VAMPIRE** ≠ DRACULA
- **HOCKEY** ≠ HOCKEY FIGHT

### GAMEPLAY DETAILS

- **Cheating:** If you accidentally cheat while you’re giving a clue, like by saying part of the name, just put that card aside and add it back in for the other team’s next turn.

- **Scoring:** At the end of a turn, teams keep the cards they guessed correctly. These will be scored at the end of the round. Put any skipped cards on the bottom of the deck.

- **Turn Order:** Teams take turns giving clues. And each person should take a turn giving clues to their team before anyone repeats being the clue giver. Going in clockwise order usually helps to remember.

- **End of Round:** A round ends when **ALL** cards from the deck have been guessed correctly.

- When that happens, teams count each card they correctly guessed.

- Write those numbers down somewhere (e.g. “Team B is up one on Team A”), then shuffle all the cards back together into one deck for the next round.

- **Next Round:** You’ll be playing with the exact same cards. The team with the **lowest score** starts the next round, even if they just went.

- **Pity Turn:** If someone ended the round with an extremely short turn, like if there were only one or two cards left in the deck, give them a full turn the next round.

## RULES FOR EACH ROUND

### ROUND 1: SAY ANYTHING

You can do anything except say the name itself, using any words, sounds, or gestures you can think of. Reading the clue text is allowed, but should be a mildly embarrassing thing to do.

### ROUND 2: ONE WORD

Use only one word. It can be anything except the name itself. You can repeat the word as much as you want, using different intonations if you like, but no sounds or gestures.

- **Note:** If you encounter a card you skipped earlier in your turn, you have to use the same word!

### ROUND 3: CHARADES

Just charades. No words. Sound effects are OK—within reason.

---

## ENDING THE GAME

The team in the lead after 3 rounds wins!

**Tie-Breaker / Bonus Round:**
If there’s a tie, or if you just want to keep going, roll a die and play one of the ridiculous 4th rounds:

1. Get a bed sheet. Now do charades **UNDER** it.

2. Two players alternate saying a single word. They have to form a roughly grammatical sentence.

3. Get behind a large object. Now stick your head out. You can only use head movements and sound effects.

4. Get behind a large object. Now stick out your arms. You can only use them to gesture, plus sound effects.

5. Charades, but another person on your team has to stand behind the clue giver and pose them.

6. Reverse charades! Everyone on the team does charades, except one lucky person who has to guess.

## CO-OP MODE (For 5 or fewer players)

If you have 5 or fewer people, playing cooperatively is better!

### SETUP

The rules are the same, except you create a roughly 25 card deck, then add some random cards no one has seen to round it up to a 30 card deck.

| PLAYERS       | DEAL | PICK | ADD       |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | --------- |
| **3 PLAYERS** | 15   | 8    | 6 RANDOMS |
| **4 PLAYERS** | 12   | 6    | 6 RANDOMS |
| **5 PLAYERS** | 10   | 5    | 5 RANDOMS |

### HOW TO WIN

Play the game like normal, taking turns giving clues. You just don’t alternate between teams. You're trying to finish the game in the fewest number of rounds! Keep track of the number of rounds it takes you to finish the full game.

_Note: For scoring, even a short turn counts._

### SCORING (Your fortune awaits)

- **6 TURNS OR LESS:** You’ve merged minds completely. You think each other’s thoughts, feel each other’s feelings, and dream each other’s dreams for the rest of your equally-long lives.

- **7 TURNS:** The power of your bond shines so brightly that demons are drawn to its power. Good luck!

- **8 TURNS:** Time to go into business together! You open a law firm for charades injuries.

- **9 TURNS:** Tonight, mother will bake you a cake to celebrate your victory and then tuck you into the big big bed you all sleep in. But tomorrow, it’s back to chores.

- **10 TURNS:** Whoa! You each have been granted one wish which will come true two hundred years from now. Use them wisely!

- **11 TURNS:** Somewhere in Pennsylvania, a whole town just burst into applause for you, without knowing why. They will never stop.

- **12 TURNS:** Tonight, there will be a sweet plump grape waiting under your pillows for you.

- **13 TURNS:** Tonight, there will be a mediocre grape waiting under your pillows for you. But hey, a grape’s a grape.

- **14 TURNS:** You will never know peace in this life until you get a slightly better score in Monikers score.

- **15 TURNS OR MORE:** Time to all start walking different directions as far as you can go and never speak to each other again. Sorry!
