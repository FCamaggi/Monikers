# MONIKERS

## What's in a name?

**Monikers**
This is another word for 'name'. That's what the game revolves around. Well, it's mostly focused on names, but there also are some "this is what we call it" items.

- **Example:** Social isolation - keeping yourself at a distance from everyone - it may not crop up in the game, but it's an example.

- "Social isolation" isn't perhaps what could properly be called a 'name', but it's certainly what we 'call' something.

- Bear in mind - on every card there is something that the designers have called a name - but a small number are not really names, they're what we call it.

## What kind of a game is it?

It can be shouty, screamy, and mind-challenging fun. It's clue giving, and clue guessing. It's about two teams guessing the name on the card that the team's clue-giver has in hand.

- Players within the teams take turns in giving clues.

- There are three types of round in the game - and each round must be navigated.

- Each type of round differs in the way that clue-givers are able to give their clues.

- So, there are three very different ways that clue givers must try to assist their team-mates towards guessing the name that's on the card.

## Rounds and their rules

The game runs over three rounds.
It will go through several turns within each round - not just once. It may go around each team more than once. Each round proceeds turn by turn, until all the cards in the game deck have been guessed.

### Round one

Without giving any part of the target name itself, the clue giver can use any words, sounds, accents or gestures.

- 'The' and 'a' and the like are not banned, but shortenings or spellings are.

- Even the description on the card may be used: in part or in full.

- If any part of the target name is spoken by the clue giver, they must be upright and honest, and skip the card.

### Round two

By now, of course, all players will have observed all the cards' names being guessed during round one - which is just as well! Because in this round, clue givers are permitted to give nothing more than a single word as their clue.

- They can say that word until they are blue in the face, but they may say no others, and must make no signs, gestures, sounds or noises.

- Involuntary cursing will not count against them, however.

- So, some memory for what's gone before will be especially useful.

### Round three

Monikers makes sure that nothing stands still, so round three is different again. Here, with the usual 60 seconds per turn, clue givers must act, gesticulate, or make (reasonable) sound effects.

- But they may utter not a single word!

- Charades is the name of the game now.

### Finish

The end of round three is the end of the game.

## Getting started

1.  **Teams:** Set up two balanced teams.

2.  **The Deal:** Deal each person 10 cards. Everyone chooses 5 that they like.

- The name and the information on them will be used by clue givers and guessers.

- Unchosen cards go back into the box, set aside for the rest of the game.

3.  **The Deck:** The chosen card deck is best at around 40-50 cards (make adjustments as appropriate).

4.  **Shuffle:** The chosen cards are shuffled into a single game deck.

5.  **Agreements:** You might like to decide to what extent partial correctness in guessing is going to be allowed. If there are challenges during play please leave them until the turn's finished.

## The cards

_(Based on the example card provided in the text)_

**The Transportation Security Administration (TSA)**

> The branch of the U.S. government that controls safety in airports. Created as a response to 9/11, we now mostly take for granted this extreme invasion of privacy and restriction of freedom of travel.

- **Category:** ET CETERA

- **Point Value:** 1 POINT

- **The Name:** Here's the card's 'name' - that which is to be guessed by the team. No part of it may ever be uttered by the clue giver (Apart from 'the').

- **The Description:** This description can put you in the picture if you've no idea who or what the 'name' is all about. In round 1, it can be read aloud in full.

- **Category:** This is the category into which the clue falls.

- **Score:** The score if the team guesses the name.

## Gameplay

### Turns

There may be many turns in each of the three rounds. There's no fixed number.

- **Time:** In each turn, a team's clue giver has 60 seconds (or whatever time you choose) in which to enable their team to guess as many of the cards' names as possible.

- **Rotation:** Teams take it in turns to have their turn, and the role of clue giver must pass from player to player within each team.

- **Seating:** Teams don't have to sit together, but they must know who's who.

- **Timer:** Each turn lasts for an agreed time, so a timer's essential.

### Correct guesses

Cards guessed correctly are placed face up in front of the clue giver. They will be gathered together to score the team's success when the game comes to an end.

### Incorrect guesses

Clue givers tell their team when incorrectly guesses are made.

- They may keep the card and its name 'open' for further guesses if they choose.

- Or they can skip the card, even if incorrect guesses have been made.

### Skipping

The clue giver can skip a card - they can skip as many as they want.

- Skipped cards are placed face down in front of the clue giver.

- At the end of their turn, they are shuffled back into the game deck, ready to be passed to the next clue giver.

### Scoring

In each round, when all cards have been guessed, teams gain the scores shown on cards they guessed.

### Reshuffling

- **Turns:** At the end of each turn, cards that were skipped by the clue giver are shuffled into the game deck, which is passed to the next clue giver (less cards that were correctly guessed).

- **Rounds:** When all the cards have been guessed and scored, all the cards are put back into the game deck and shuffled, ready for the next round.
